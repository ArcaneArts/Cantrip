# Provider inference concurrency

Provider configuration stores `maxConcurrentInference` (positive PostgreSQL
integer, default 8) and `inferenceConfigRevision` (initially 0). The database
advances the revision atomically only when the limit changes. Mutation inputs
keep the limit optional so updates from older clients preserve it. Provider
summaries and resolved model runtimes carry the configuration through both the
Node and Rust server implementations.

`WorkerInferenceAdmission` belongs to one server/owner/worker generation. Its
provider pools are outside the project, account, model, and native-runtime maps.
Runtime envelopes update the shared pool with their revision; stale revisions
are ignored, and legacy envelopes cannot reset an established pool.

Each opaque runtime handle owns idempotent operation identities. Admission
reserves capacity synchronously in FIFO order before resolving its promise. A
ticket moves from waiting to granted to running, with cancelling retaining
running capacity until the owner explicitly confirms settlement. Unstarted
requests can be cancelled immediately. Observers receive coalesced snapshots
with worker generation, revision, counts, and one-based waiting positions.
Observer failures cannot hold or release execution capacity.

Runtime retirement requires confirmed execution termination; a caller must not
retire a runtime on a timeout, missing output, or an observing UI disconnect.
Retirement invalidates its grants, removes its pending requests, and releases
its holders. Late callbacks retain their old handle and cannot affect a
replacement runtime. Settled operations remain idempotent for that runtime's
lifetime; retirement releases the record set.

## Delivery status

The foundation includes persisted configuration, runtime propagation, worker
ownership, and the admission primitive. Root GUI chat turns and managed native
turns (terminal input, queued starts, Tasks, and autonomous goal cycles) now acquire
before forwarding their actual native start. Each completed cycle releases its
ticket independently of later workspace reconciliation and UI publication. A
continuation must acquire again through the same provider queue.

Native ticket correlation lives separately from UI execution tracking. Actual
turn IDs and terminal notifications settle tickets; a native rejection before
an observed start releases the unused reservation. A disconnected socket cancels
unforwarded work but retains dispatched holders until actual process exit. The
captured process-exit hook remains valid after socket or child-handle replacement.
Explicit Stop can cancel a queued chat before it has a native turn ID.

The remaining milestones must cover auxiliary inference and suspended waits,
durable recovery and live settings propagation, app feedback, and the final
inference-path audit. Parallel child inference and helper operations are not yet
covered. This intermediate implementation is not the completed feature.

Local review is restricted to source inspection, formatting, and diff checks by
the goal's explicit no-testing instruction. Runtime behavior remains unexecuted.
